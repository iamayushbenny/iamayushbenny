# 👋 Hey, I’m Ayush Benny

**💻 Full-Stack Developer • 🧠 ML Engineer • ☁️ Cloud Enthusiast**

I’m a builder at heart who loves turning ideas into scalable systems.  
From designing robust APIs to experimenting with LLMs, I focus on writing clean, efficient, and secure backend code — the kind that actually scales.  

I started with breaking and securing systems (thanks, cybersecurity 👀), but I’ve since moved toward building them — better, faster, and smarter.  
Now I’m obsessed with system design, backend architecture, and integrating intelligence (AI/DL) into everyday dev workflows.
